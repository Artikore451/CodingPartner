	</li>
	<li>
	<p>It produces efficient programs</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>It can handle low-level activities</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h1>Facts about C</h1>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The UNIX OS was totally written in C.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.</p>

	<p>Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h1>Hello World using C Programming.</h1>

<p>Just to give you a little excitement about&nbsp;<strong>C programming</strong>, I&#39;m going to give you a small conventional C Programming Hello World program</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main() {</p>

<p>&nbsp;/* my first program in C */</p>

<p>&nbsp;printf(&quot;Hello, World! \n&quot;);</p>

<p>&nbsp;return 0;&nbsp;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tokens in C</h2>

<p>A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens &minus;</p>

<pre>
printf(&quot;Hello, World! \n&quot;);</pre>

<p>The individual tokens are &minus;</p>

<pre>
printf
(
   &quot;Hello, World! \n&quot;
)
;</pre>

<h2>Semicolons</h2>

<p>In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.</p>

<p>Given below are two different statements &minus;</p>

<pre>
printf(&quot;Hello, World! \n&quot;);
return 0;</pre>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below &minus;</p>

<pre>
/* my first program in C */</pre>

<p>You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.</p>

<h2>Identifiers</h2>

<p>A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore &#39;_&#39; followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).</p>

<p>C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a&nbsp;<strong>case-sensitive</strong>&nbsp;programming language. Thus,&nbsp;<em>Manpower</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>manpower</em>&nbsp;are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers &minus;</p>

<pre>
mohd       zara    abc   move_name  a_123
myname50   _temp   j     a23b9      retVal</pre>

<h2>Keywords</h2>

<p>The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://myfiles.space/user_files/100040_6e3564a4a138a481/100040_custom_files/img1633102287.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Integer Types</h2>

<p>The following table provides the details of standard integer types with their storage sizes and value ranges &minus;</p>

	</tbody>
</table>

<p>To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the&nbsp;<strong>sizeof</strong>&nbsp;operator. The expressions&nbsp;<em>sizeof(type)</em>&nbsp;yields the storage size of the object or type in bytes. Given below is an example to get the size of various type on a machine using different constant defined in limits.h header file &minus;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>C - Functions</h1>

<p>A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is&nbsp;<strong>main()</strong>, and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.</p>

<p>You can divide up your code into separate functions. How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division is such that each function performs a specific task.</p>

<p>A function&nbsp;<strong>declaration</strong>&nbsp;tells the compiler about a function&#39;s name, return type, and parameters. A function&nbsp;<strong>definition</strong>&nbsp;provides the actual body of the function.</p>

<p>The C standard library provides numerous built-in functions that your program can call. For example,&nbsp;<strong>strcat()</strong>&nbsp;to concatenate two strings,&nbsp;<strong>memcpy()</strong>&nbsp;to copy one memory location to another location, and many more functions.</p>

<p>A function can also be referred as a method or a sub-routine or a procedure, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Defining a Function</h2>

<p>The general form of a function definition in C programming language is as follows &minus;</p>

<pre>
return_type function_name( parameter list ) {
   body of the function
}</pre>

<h2>Function Declarations</h2>

<p>A function&nbsp;<strong>declaration</strong>&nbsp;tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function. The actual body of the function can be defined separately.</p>

<p>A function declaration has the following parts &minus;</p>

<pre>
return_type function_name( parameter list );</pre>

<p>For the above defined function max(), the function declaration is as follows &minus;</p>

<pre>
int max(int num1, int num2);</pre>

<p>Parameter names are not important in function declaration only their type is required, so the following is also a valid declaration &minus;</p>

<pre>
int max(int, int);</pre>

<p>Function declaration is required when you define a function in one source file and you call that function in another file. In such case, you should declare the function at the top of the file calling the function.</p>

<h2>Calling a Function</h2>

<p>While creating a C function, you give a definition of what the function has to do. To use a function, you will have to call that function to perform the defined task.</p>

<p>When a program calls a function, the program control is transferred to the called function. A called function performs a defined task and when its return statement is executed or when its function-ending closing brace is reached, it returns the program control back to the main program.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Function Arguments</h2>

<p>If a function is to use arguments, it must declare variables that accept the values of the arguments. These variables are called the&nbsp;<strong>formal parameters</strong>&nbsp;of the function.</p>

<p>Formal parameters behave like other local variables inside the function and are created upon entry into the function and destroyed upon exit.</p>

<p>While calling a function, there are two ways in which arguments can be passed to a function &minus;</p>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Sr.No.</th>
			<th>Call Type &amp; Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_function_call_by_value.htm">Call by value</a>
			<p>This method copies the actual value of an argument into the formal parameter of the function. In this case, changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the argument.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2</td>
			<td><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_function_call_by_reference.htm">Call by reference</a>
			<p>This method copies the address of an argument into the formal parameter. Inside the function, the address is used to access the actual argument used in the call. This means that changes made to the parameter affect the argument.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>By default, C uses&nbsp;<strong>call by value</strong>&nbsp;to pass arguments. In general, it means the code within a function cannot alter the arguments used to call the function.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>C - Arrays</h1>

<p>Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.</p>

<p>Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Declaring Arrays</h2>

<p>To declare an array in C, a programmer specifies the type of the elements and the number of elements required by an array as follows &minus;</p>

<pre>
type arrayName [ arraySize ];</pre>

<p>This is called a&nbsp;<em>single-dimensional</em>&nbsp;array. The&nbsp;<strong>arraySize</strong>&nbsp;must be an integer constant greater than zero and&nbsp;<strong>type</strong>&nbsp;can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called&nbsp;<strong>balance</strong>&nbsp;of type double, use this statement &minus;</p>

<pre>
double balance[10];</pre>

<p>Here&nbsp;<em>balance</em>&nbsp;is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.</p>

<h2>Initializing Arrays</h2>

<p>You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows &minus;</p>

<pre>
double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};</pre>

<p>The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].</p>

<p>If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write &minus;</p>

<pre>
double balance[] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};</pre>

<p>You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array &minus;</p>

<pre>
balance[4] = 50.0;</pre>

<p>The above statement assigns the 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;element in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called the base index and the last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Shown below is the pictorial representation of the array we discussed above &minus;</p>

<p><img alt="Array Presentation" src="https://myfiles.space/user_files/100040_6e3564a4a138a481/100040_custom_files/img1633102876.png" /></p>

<h2>Accessing Array Elements</h2>

<p>An element is accessed by indexing the array name. This is done by placing the index of the element within square brackets after the name of the array. For example &minus;</p>

<pre>
double salary = balance[9];</pre>

<h1>Pointers</h1>

<p>Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. Let&#39;s start learning them in simple and easy steps.</p>

<p>As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&amp;) operator, which denotes an address in memory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Take a look at some of the valid pointer declarations &minus;</p>

<pre>
int    *ip;    /* pointer to an integer */
double *dp;    /* pointer to a double */
float  *fp;    /* pointer to a float */
char   *ch     /* pointer to a character */</pre>

<p>The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>

<p>int main () {</p>

<p>&nbsp;int var = 20;</p>

<p>&nbsp;/* actual variable declaration */</p>

<p>&nbsp;int *ip; /* pointer variable declaration */</p>

<p>&nbsp;ip = &amp;var; /* store address of var in pointer variable*/</p>

<p>&nbsp;printf(&quot;Address of var variable: %x\n&quot;, &amp;var ); /* address stored in pointer variable */&nbsp;</p>

<p>printf(&quot;Address stored in ip variable: %x\n&quot;, ip ); /* access the value using the pointer */&nbsp;</p>

<p>printf(&quot;Value of *ip variable: %d\n&quot;, *ip );</p>

<p>&nbsp;return 0;&nbsp;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Address of var variable: bffd8b3c&nbsp;</p>

<p>Address stored in ip&nbsp;</p>

<p>variable: bffd8b3c Value of *ip variable: 20</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Structures</h1>

<p>Arrays allow to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind. Similarly&nbsp;<strong>structure</strong>&nbsp;is another user defined data type available in C that allows to combine data items of different kinds.</p>

<p>Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book &minus;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Title</li>
	<li>Author</li>
	<li>Subject</li>
	<li>Book ID</li>
</ul>

<h2>Defining a Structure</h2>

<p>To define a structure, you must use the&nbsp;<strong>struct</strong>&nbsp;statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member. The format of the struct statement is as follows &minus;</p>

<pre>
struct [structure tag] {

   member definition;
   member definition;
   ...
   member definition;
} [one or more structure variables];&nbsp;&nbsp;</pre>

<h2>Pointers to Structures</h2>

<p>You can define pointers to structures in the same way as you define pointer to any other variable &minus;</p>

<pre>
struct Books *struct_pointer;</pre>

<p>Now, you can store the address of a structure variable in the above defined pointer variable. To find the address of a structure variable, place the &#39;&amp;&#39;; operator before the structure&#39;s name as follows &minus;</p>

<pre>
struct_pointer = &amp;Book1;</pre>

<p>To access the members of a structure using a pointer to that structure, you must use the &rarr; operator as follows &minus;</p>

<pre>
struct_pointer-&gt;title;</pre>

<h1>Unions</h1>

<p>A&nbsp;<strong>union</strong>&nbsp;is a special data type available in C that allows to store different data types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same memory location for multiple-purpose.</p>

<h2>Defining a Union</h2>

<p>To define a union, you must use the&nbsp;<strong>union</strong>&nbsp;statement in the same way as you did while defining a structure. The union statement defines a new data type with more than one member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows &minus;</p>

<pre>
union [union tag] {
   member definition;
   member definition;
   ...
   member definition;
} [one or more union variables];  </pre>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>union tag</strong>&nbsp;is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union&#39;s definition, before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional. Here is the way you would define a union type named Data having three members i, f, and str &minus;</p>

<pre>
union Data {
   int i;
   float f;
   char str[20];
} data;  </pre>

<p>Now, a variable of&nbsp;<strong>Data</strong>&nbsp;type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of characters. It means a single variable, i.e., same memory location, can be used to store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a union based on your requirement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Accessing Union Members</h2>

<p>To access any member of a union, we use the&nbsp;<strong>member access operator (.)</strong>. The member access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union member that we wish to access. You would use the keyword&nbsp;<strong>union</strong>&nbsp;to define variables of union type.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Error Handling</h1>

<p>As such, C programming does not provide direct support for error handling but being a system programming language, it provides you access at lower level in the form of return values. Most of the C or even Unix function calls return -1 or NULL in case of any error and set an error code&nbsp;<strong>errno</strong>. It is set as a global variable and indicates an error occurred during any function call. You can find various error codes defined in &lt;error.h&gt; header file.</p>

<p>So a C programmer can check the returned values and can take appropriate action depending on the return value. It is a good practice, to set errno to 0 at the time of initializing a program. A value of 0 indicates that there is no error in the program.</p>

<h2>errno, perror(). and strerror()</h2>

<p>The C programming language provides&nbsp;<strong>perror()</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>strerror()</strong>&nbsp;functions which can be used to display the text message associated with&nbsp;<strong>errno</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The&nbsp;<strong>perror()</strong>&nbsp;function displays the string you pass to it, followed by a colon, a space, and then the textual representation of the current errno value.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The&nbsp;<strong>strerror()</strong>&nbsp;function, which returns a pointer to the textual representation of the current errno value.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Let&#39;s try to simulate an error condition and try to open a file which does not exist. Here I&#39;m using both the functions to show the usage, but you can use one or more ways of printing your errors. Second important point to note is that you should use&nbsp;<strong>stderr</strong>&nbsp;file stream to output all the errors.</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

extern int errno ;

int main () {

   FILE * pf;
   int errnum;
   pf = fopen (&quot;unexist.txt&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   if (pf == NULL) {
   
      errnum = errno;
      fprintf(stderr, &quot;Value of errno: %d\n&quot;, errno);
      perror(&quot;Error printed by perror&quot;);
      fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error opening file: %s\n&quot;, strerror( errnum ));
   } else {
   
      fclose (pf);
   }
   
   return 0;
}</pre>

<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<pre>
Value of errno: 2
Error printed by perror: No such file or directory
